# Liam-Horton-Data-Projects
Here are several projects undertaken as part of my undergraduate studies at Montclair State Univeristy (Class of 2023). 
1. Logistic Regression on diabetes dataset
2. kNN Classifier on diabetes dataset 
3. Logistic regression, kNN, and decision tree classifier on wine dataset. 
4. Diamond price prediction models with parameter optimization 
5. Sklearn Neural Network on bank loan data 
6. Final Project on Stroke Dataset 
    - Range of classification models (Keras Deep Learning, Sklearn Neural Network, XGboost, Boosted Tree, Random Forrest)
    - Analysis of feature importance 
    - Threshold Optimization
    - Parameter optimization
7. Web scraping with XPath (Yelp Reviews) 
8. Sklearn Classifiers on Yelp reviews 
    - Count Vectorization of text 
    - Tfidf Vectorization of text 
9. Text Clustering analysis yelp reviews 
10. Deep Learning Models on Amazon Reviews
11. Final Project on Supplement Reviews (Amazon) 
    - Built a series of classification models to predict cases of false advertising/product misrepresenation based on the Amazon reviews of 2               nutritional supplements
    - Performed Text Feature analysis (i.e., identified the most informative words) using Shap
    - Performed transfer learning assesment on best performing models (trained on one supplement, tested on another)     
12. Data Preprocessing with Python 
13. Final Project Dashboarding and Visualization with Tableau
    - Calculated Fields 
    - Use of Parameters, Sets, Groups
